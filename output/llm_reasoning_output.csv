The Police Department responded to the complaint and with the information available observed no evidence of the violation at that time.,3920167,"The resolution indicates a police response, which is appropriate for many 311 complaints (noise, illegal activity, etc.). However, simply stating 'no evidence of violation' lacks detail. It doesn't specify *what* was observed, or what the complaint specifically alleged. While responding is good, documenting specific observations would strengthen the resolution. Without knowing the original complaint, it's difficult to fully assess appropriateness, but the response feels somewhat dismissive without further details.",true
The Police Department responded to the complaint and took action to fix the condition.,3256359,"The resolution states police responded and 'took action,' but provides no specifics about *what* action was taken or if it resolved the reported condition. This is insufficient documentation for a government audit; simply stating action occurred isn't enough to verify appropriate response. It lacks detail regarding the nature of the problem and how it was addressed.",false
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development inspected the following conditions. No violations were issued. The complaint has been closed.,2670084,"The resolution indicates an inspection was performed by HPD, which is appropriate for many housing-related 311 complaints. However, simply stating 'no violations were issued' doesn't detail *what* conditions were inspected or why no violations were found. While it closes the loop, a more detailed description of the inspection findings would be beneficial to confirm appropriate action. Without specifics about what was checked, it is difficult to definitively say if the response fully addressed the potential issue.",false
The Police Department responded to the complaint and determined that police action was not necessary.,1758910,"The resolution indicates a response from the Police Department, which is appropriate given the open-ended nature of many 311 complaints potentially involving safety or disturbances. However, it lacks specifics about *why* police action wasn't needed. While acknowledging a response is good, simply stating 'not necessary' doesn’t demonstrate sufficient investigation or resolution detail for audit purposes. It could mean they investigated and found nothing, or that they didn't investigate thoroughly. Without more information, it's difficult to confirm appropriate action.",false
Service Request status for this request is available on the Department of Transportationâs website. Please click the âLearn Moreâ link below.,1645645,"The resolution simply directs the complainant to another website without detailing any specific action taken by 311 or DOT to address the reported issue. It's a deflection rather than a resolution, and lacks documentation of concrete steps. While providing a link *could* be helpful, it doesn't demonstrate that the city responded to the complaint.",false
The Police Department responded and upon arrival those responsible for the condition were gone.,1442567,"The resolution indicates a police response to an unspecified condition. While a response occurred, it doesn't detail *what* condition was reported or if any remediation took place (e.g., cleaning, warning issued). Simply noting they were 'gone' isn't sufficient; the complaint likely concerned an ongoing issue requiring action beyond observation.",false
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development inspected the following conditions. Violations were issued. Information about specific violations is available at www.nyc.gov/hpd.,1271551,"The resolution describes an inspection by HPD and issuance of violations, which aligns with likely complaint types related to housing issues (e.g., unsafe conditions, illegal apartments). While it doesn't detail *what* the violations were for, it confirms action was taken beyond simply acknowledging the complaint. Providing a link to further information is good practice. The response appears appropriate given the context of 311 requests often being initial reports triggering investigation.",true
N/A,1268346,"The resolution description is 'N/A', indicating no action was taken or details are missing. This is insufficient to determine appropriate response.",false
"The Department of Housing Preservation and Development was not able to gain access to inspect the following conditions. The complaint has been closed. If the condition still exists, please file a new complaint.",1112957,"The resolution states HPD attempted access but failed, leading to closure without inspection. While documenting the inability to access is *a* step, it doesn't resolve the underlying issue. Simply asking the complainant to re-submit isn't appropriate action; further attempts or explanation of why access couldn't be gained should have been documented. This indicates a lack of resolution.",false
The Police Department issued a summons in response to the complaint.,970134,"The resolution states a summons was issued by the police department. This suggests the complaint likely involved a violation of some rule or law, making it an appropriate response. However, without knowing the original complaint type, it's impossible to definitively say if this was *the* appropriate action, but issuing a summons is a documented action.",true
